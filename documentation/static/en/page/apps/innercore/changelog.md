-   toScriptable() - returns javascript object, that represents contents
-   getAllKeys() - returns java array with all keys

-   remove(key) - deletes value by key
-   clear() - deletes all values

NBT.ListTag (list, non-negative integer indices):

-   constructor() - creates empty list
-   constructor(NBT.ListTag) - creates list copy
-   toScriptable() - returns javascript object, that represents contents
-   length() - returns list length
-   getValueType(index) - returns value type by index (type is integer)
